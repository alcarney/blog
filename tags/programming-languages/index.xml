      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.alcarney.me/blog/2020/ast-simple-eval/&#34;&gt;Previously&lt;/a&gt;, as part of my exploration
into how programming languages are implemented, I wrote a very simple AST
evaluator that knew how to add and multiply floats together. Since constructing
these ASTs by hand is quite painful I thought it would be fun to come up with a
frontend to my &amp;ldquo;programming language&amp;rdquo; which could do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your typical frontend would be some kind of parser built into the
compiler/interpreter. However, while I&amp;rsquo;m definitely interested in parsing I
don&amp;rsquo;t quite feel like tackling that just yet. Instead I&amp;rsquo;m going to have Python
be the frontend and embed my toy language into it via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html&#34;&gt;CPython
Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evaluating a Simple Abstract Syntax Tree</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Programming languages and their implementation is a topic I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested
in for a long time and I thought it would be worth trying to get a bit more
hands on and play with some of the ideas in this space. Choosing a topic
somewhat at random I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to take a look at implementing an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
