      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not that you would have known it, but I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blog since 2014.  Well 2015 if
you&amp;rsquo;re feeling generous, the first (and only) post went up in the last few
hours of New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve. It was a look back on some of the projects I had
worked on that year and I announced my intentions to start blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward nearly 4 years and here I am announcing my intentions to start
blogging - &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;. So I guess you are wondering what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at running a blog was using &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and for some mystical reason
(It&amp;rsquo;s been so long I can&amp;rsquo;t actually remember why), I decided that it was not the
static site generator I was looking for. So I promptly set off on a voyage of
discovery in search of the ultimate static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
