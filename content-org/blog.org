:END:

A few weeks back at [[https://2018.pyconuk.org/][PyConUK]] I gave my first [[https://youtu.be/F5jSUJVymXk?t=3480][lighting talk]]
at a conference. During that talk I spoke publically about [[https://github.com/alcarney/stylo][stylo]] for
the first time. Stylo is a Python library that I have been working on for just
over a year and a half and it aims to make the creation of images easier by
bringing together ideas from programming and mathematics.

Version [[https://alcarney.github.io/stylo/changes.html][0.6.0]] was recently released which included the first feature
that wasn't written by me! It's very exciting not only to see other people
starting to take an interest in the project but taking the time to make a
contribution!

Now that stylo seems to be getting to the point that it might me useful to
other people wouldn't it be great if there was a community driven example
gallery that people could get inspired by? - Well now there is! And it's
called [[https://alcarney.github.io/stylo-doodles][Stylo Doodles]]

[[/images/stylo-doodles.png]]

All the examples are written as a [[https://jupyter.org][Jupyter Notebook]] and can be submitted to the
gallery by opening a pull request against the stylo-doodles [[https://github.com/alcarney/stylo-doodles][repository]]. A small
python application is then run that builds the website and pushes the update to
the live website.

** Current Features

The gallery website is very new but it currently has the following features

- All images are displayed in a grid on the homepage with the order randomly
  chosen each time the website is built.
- Each image has its own page (as shown above) which displays the full
  resolution image along with information about the author, image and the
  version of stylo used to generate it.
- The source code from the notebook is extracted and is also displayed
  alongside the image.
- You can also play around with any example *live in your browser* if you
  follow the [[https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/alcarney/stylo-doodles/master][binder]] link in the repository's README.

** Adding Your Own Example

If you have an image that you would like to share there are only a couple of
things you need to do:

1. Your image *must* be stored in a variable called ~image~. The build process
   will [[https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Importing%2520Notebooks.html][import your notebook]] as a Python module and look for a variable called
   ~image~.

2. You also need to provide some additional information to the build system
   about your example in the form of a Python dictionary. This dictionary
   *must* be called ~info~ and it must be in *very first cell of the notebook*

   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   info = {
        "title": "Jack-O-Lantern",
        "author": "Alex Carney",
        "github_username": "alcarney",
        "stylo_version": "0.6.0",
        "dimensions": (1920, 1080)
    }
   #+END_SRC

   The ~stylo_version~ field should be set to the value of ~stylo.__version__~
   at the time you created your image. The ~dimensions~ is tuple of the form
   ~(width, height)~ and will be used by the build system to determine the size
   of the image (in pixels) when it renders the full size copy for its detail
   page.

3. Once your example is ready open a pull request adding your notebook to the
   ~notebooks/~ folder to the repository.

Be sure to check out the existing [[https://github.com/alcarney/stylo-doodles/tree/master/notebooks][examples]] to use as a guide or drop by the
stylo [[https://gitter.im/stylo-py/Lobby][Gitter]] room if you get stuck we'll be more than happy to help!

** Future Developments

Stylo Doodles is far from finished aside from adding examples there are many
more things that could be added to the website:

- *User profiles:* A page for every author, which lists the examples they
  have contributed to the gallery.

- *Search*: As the number of images grow users would probably want to be able
  to tag their images and be able to narrow down the list of images on the
  homepage.

- *Recently Added:* Since the order of the homepage is random, as the number
  of images increases the chance of a new image being buried at the bottom will
  also increase, it would be good to have a way of sorting the images by date
  added.

- *Descriptions:* Jupyter Notebooks support more than just code. Cells
  containing markdown can be placed in between code cells to provide extra
  context and explanation. It would be great if we could include these on the
  site as well.

If you are looking for a web based python project to get involved with this
would be a great one to get started with and I would be more than happy to have
a few contribuitors to work on this (or even stylo itself!) with me.

* DONE I've Started a Blog... Again!                               :blogging:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_DATE: 2018-09-22
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: first-article
:EXPORT_DESCRIPTION: First article with ox-hugo
:END:

Not that you would have known it, but I've had a blog since 2014.  Well 2015 if
you're feeling generous, the first (and only) post went up in the last few
hours of New Year's Eve. It was a look back on some of the projects I had
worked on that year and I announced my intentions to start blogging.

Fast forward nearly 4 years and here I am announcing my intentions to start
blogging - *again*. So I guess you are wondering what happened?

I got lost.

My first attempt at running a blog was using [[https://jekyllrb.com][Jekyll]] and for some mystical reason
(It's been so long I can't actually remember why), I decided that it was not the
static site generator I was looking for. So I promptly set off on a voyage of
discovery in search of the ultimate static site generator.

Here is a list of some of the other static site generators I have played with
over the years in no particular order:

- [[http://www.metalsmith.io/][Metalsmith]]: Written in Javascript, this one appealed to me with
  its "everything is a plugin" approach. In theory I should be able to add any
  feature I wanted simply by finding/writing the right plugin.

- [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]]: I was going through a Haskell phase and I thought it would
  be a great idea to have my blog powered with it as well. *Haskell all the
  things!*

- [[http://www.sphinx-doc.org][Sphinx]]: Sphinx is an awesome tool for writing
  documentation. A big part of that is [[http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html][reStructuredText]], add in the [[https://ablog.readthedocs.io/][ABlog]]
  extension and you should have a great setup for a blog.

- [[https://blog.getpelican.com/][Pelican]] & [[https://getnikola.com/][Nikola]]: However as Sphinx is primarily built
  for documentation projects, I found that I was fighting it more
  than anything. That led me to take a look at Pelican and Nikola, both written
  in Python and have support for reStructuredText and
  [[http://jupyter.org/][Jupyter]].

- [[https://vuepress.vuejs.org/][Vuepress]]: Having played around a bit with [[https://vuejs.org/][VueJS]], the
  thought of being able to take a dynamic site written in a powerful frontend
  framework and make a static site out of it seemed appealing. The best of both
  worlds.

- [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]: Who *doesn't* want a static site generator written in Go? :)

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] & [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]]: Yes, [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html][you can]] use emacs
  as a static site generator.

At this point you might be wondering what was wrong with all of the above so
that after nearly 4 years of tinkering I still had nothing to show for it?

Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

The problem was with me. I wanted complete control over the output, from the
contents of ~<head>~ to the CSS styling of links. There would always
be a point where I would start fighting against the very abstractions
designed to make my life easier! It got to the point where I even tried writing
my own static site generator...

** A New Perspective

After endless hours lost fiddling with scripts and stylesheets I stumbled
across a quote on the internet that would snap me out of my spiral of perpetual
procrastination.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
    The technology you use *impresses no one*.

    The experience you create with it is *everything*. -- [[https://twitter.com/ideakitchn?lang=en][Sean Gerety]]
#+END_QUOTE

I have found myself saying this again and again, so much so that I think it may
have fundamentally altered the way I think about programming. I fell into a
trap of getting caught up in the merits of the technology for the sake of the
technology itself and lost sight of the experience - the blog itself.

Rejuvenated I've gone back to where it all started and have started using [[https://jekyllrb.com][Jekyll]]
again. I'm using the [[https://fongandrew.github.io/hydeout/][Hydeout]] theme as it's built in a way that allows me to make
a few (minor!) tweaks of my own. Within a few hours I was already working on the
draft that became this blog post, a place I never even got to in most of my
previous attempts.

It turns out that Markdown is a perfectly acceptable format for a blog. You
don't have to engineer your blog's theme from the ground up especially when a
prebuilt theme exists in the style you were going to build yourself anyway. It
doesn't matter that your blog can seamlessly format a Jupyter Notebook as a
regular blog post when you don't have any notebooks to publish in the first
place...

What matters is the content itself, that you have something interesting to say
and you have some way of making that available to other people. Everything else
is just an implementation detail, which if done right is invisible to the
consumers of your content anyway.

It's strange that I had learn something that is probably obvious to most people
the hard way but I'm here now. If you are reading this then things are looking
up but I can't quite declare victory as I'm no further forward than I was 4
years ago, first let's see if I make it to blog post number #2...
