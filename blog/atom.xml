&lt;p&gt;Not that you would have known it, but I’ve had a blog since 2014.  Well 2015 if
you’re feeling generous, the first (and only) post went up in the last few
hours of New Year’s Eve. It was a look back on some of the projects I had
worked on that year and I announced my intentions to start blogging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward nearly 4 years and here I am announcing my intentions to start
blogging - &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;. So I guess you are wondering what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at running a blog was using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://jekyllrb.com"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and for some mystical reason
(It’s been so long I can’t actually remember why), I decided that it was not the
static site generator I was looking for. So I promptly set off on a voyage of
discovery in search of the ultimate static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks back at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://2018.pyconuk.org/"&gt;PyConUK&lt;/a&gt; I gave my first &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/F5jSUJVymXk?t=3480"&gt;lighting talk&lt;/a&gt;
at a conference. During that talk I spoke publically about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alcarney/stylo"&gt;stylo&lt;/a&gt; for
the first time. Stylo is a Python library that I have been working on for just
over a year and a half and it aims to make the creation of images easier by
bringing together ideas from programming and mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://alcarney.github.io/stylo/changes.html"&gt;0.6.0&lt;/a&gt; was recently released which included the first feature
that wasn’t written by me! It’s very exciting not only to see other people
starting to take an interest in the project but taking the time to make a
contribution!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that stylo seems to be getting to the point that it might me useful to
other people wouldn’t it be great if there was a community driven example
gallery that people could get inspired by? - Well now there is! And it’s
called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://alcarney.github.io/stylo-doodles"&gt;Stylo Doodles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post makes use of a number of interactive elements to help illustrate a few
concepts. Unfortunately these do not yet work on mobile devices - sorry mobile
users!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have for quite some time now wanted to play around with web development some
more, particularly using web technologies to build user interfaces of some
kind. However there is just &lt;strong&gt;so much&lt;/strong&gt; out there it’s been impossible for me to
really get anywhere past a “Hello, World!” tutorial before I find myself trying
out the next new shiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’ve decided to abandon everything and try a bottom up approach where I see
how far I can push the core web technologies - HTML, CSS and
JavaScript. Hopefully then by the time I start using one of the gazillion
libraries out there I will have a better understanding of why I
needed it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will be looking at implementing clicking and dragging
functionality using only vanilla JavaScript. Clicking and dragging as a concept
can apply to many kinds of interactions so in this instance I’m specifically
referring to clicking on an SVG element moving it around on the page as
illustrated by the demo above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been interested in graphics and have on numerous occasions tried
to dip my toe into the world of OpenGL and more recently Vulkan. However I have
never been able to get past the “Hello, World” of these technologies - drawing a
triangle on screen, I think mostly becuase I never really had a goal in mind
once I got that far…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s (hopefully) about to change! What better excuse than a new decade to
jump back into this world for the 100th time and try to get to all those
interesting ideas I see people playing with all the time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being an API for talking to GPUs and other compute devices every Vulkan
program starts off by looking for an appropriate &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.1-extensions/man/html/VkPhysicalDevice.html"&gt;physical device&lt;/a&gt;
to use. In this post I write a little C program that initialises the Vulkan
API and lists out the available devices in the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is part of my “Learning Vulkan” series where I try to figure how to use
Vulkan to explore various concepts in graphics programming. As mentioned in
the &lt;a class="reference internal" href="2020/learning-vulkan-p0/"&gt;&lt;span class="doc"&gt;Overview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I don’t necessarily

I’ve finally got around to taking a look at it. In this post I describe how I
managed to use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tinygo.org/"&gt;TinyGo&lt;/a&gt; to compile a “Hello, World!” Go program into
WebAssembly and execute it in the browser. So that I have something to refer
back to I also describe setting up my development environment as a container

into how programming languages are implemented, I wrote a very simple AST
evaluator that knew how to add and multiply floats together. Since constructing
these ASTs by hand is quite painful I thought it would be fun to come up with a
frontend to my “programming language” which could do it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now your typical frontend would be some kind of parser built into the
compiler/interpreter. However, while I’m definitely interested in parsing I
don’t quite feel like tackling that just yet. Instead I’m going to have Python
be the frontend and embed my toy language into it via a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html"&gt;CPython Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past year or so I’ve been working on a language server called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio"&gt;Esbonio&lt;/a&gt;.
It’s a language server designed to streamline the process of working with your
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/"&gt;Sphinx&lt;/a&gt; documentation projects. Currently its feature set is quite limited, but I
think it does a good job of providing you with completion suggestions for all your
roles, directives and cross-references.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway with the recent releases of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/github/dev"&gt;github.dev&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev"&gt;vscode.dev&lt;/a&gt; I really want to
see if I can bring Esbonio into the browser version of VSCode. There’s only one
problem… Esbonio is written in Python! 😬&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/raw/develop/resources/images/completion-demo.gif" src="https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/raw/develop/resources/images/completion-demo.gif" style="width: 80%;" /&gt;

    <title>My First Steps with Nix</title>

&lt;p&gt;Nix, depending on the context, can refer to a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/index.html"&gt;programming language&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/#preface"&gt;package manager&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation"&gt;Linux Distro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m most insterested in the package manager aspect and the promise of it being able to create declarative, reproducable development environments.
With a configuration file and the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-develop.html"&gt;nix develop&lt;/a&gt; command you can activate a kind of “virtual environment” that contains not just your Python packages - but &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; program defined by the configuration!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find that idea particuarly exciting when working on a language server like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio/"&gt;esbonio&lt;/a&gt;, since it needs to be able to work against a variety of Python versions, Sphinx versions, as well as various code editors and all their versions!
Having the ability to define a particular configuration and have some tool automatically recreate it would be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I’m getting ahead of myself, let’s see if I can get to a point where I can easily test &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;esbonio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; against a range of Python versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <summary>Nix, depending on the context, can refer to a programming language, a package manager or a Linux Distro.Personally, I’m most insterested in the package manager aspect and the promise of it being able to create declarative, reproducable development environments.
With a configuration file and the nix develop command you can activate a kind of “virtual environment” that contains not just your Python packages - but any program defined by the configuration!I find that idea particuarly exciting when working on a language server like esbonio, since it needs to be able to work against a variety of Python versions, Sphinx versions, as well as various code editors and all their versions!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference internal" href="2022/first-steps-with-nix/"&gt;&lt;span class="doc"&gt;Last time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I experimented with writing a flake that defined development environments for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/esbonio"&gt;esbonio&lt;/a&gt; package spanning multiple Python versions.
During that process I also packaged &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/pytest-lsp"&gt;pytest-lsp&lt;/a&gt; using an ad-hoc nix expression as part of the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;esbonio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I look into writing a similar flake for the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pytest-lsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; package itself, but this time using overlays to override and extend the nixpkgs package set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, you can find the final version of the code

&lt;p&gt;It turns out there were a few issues with the setup I put together in my &lt;a class="reference internal" href="2023/nix-overlays/"&gt;&lt;span class="doc"&gt;previous post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
This time I try and resolve them and get to the point where I have working overlays for both
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swyddfa/lsp-devtools/tree/develop/lib/pytest-lsp"&gt;pytest-lsp&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio"&gt;esbonio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Integrating Esbonio with Neovim Using Nix</title>

&lt;p&gt;So far I’ve been learning how to use Nix by trying to package and define development shells for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/swyddfa/esbonio"&gt;esbonio&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a class="reference internal" href="tag/nix/" title="nix"&gt;&lt;span class="xref std std-ref"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested).
While useful, the end result is not too dissimilar to what you can get with standard Python tooling.
Indeed, the main reason I started looking into Nix was the promise of it being able to manage more than just Python libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;esbonio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is a language server, it would be useful for Nix to create standardised environments where the language server is pre-configured for a given editor - great for debugging and demos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I try to define an environment in which Neovim is installed and configured to use the &lt;code class="docutils literal notranslate"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;esbonio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; language server for reStructuredText files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post marks a change in my usage of Nix, I’m (just!) past the point of trying to get &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; to work and now starting to incorporate it into some of my regular workflows.
So instead of trying to accomplish some major task, this post is a small collection of things I’ve learned over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I look at setting up a local development environment for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brettcannon/cpython-wasi-build"&gt;WASI build of Python&lt;/a&gt;  using Nix.
You can see the final result &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alcarney/python-wasi-nix"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
